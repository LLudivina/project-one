# Project Overview:

## Why study Climate Change?
Using the US territory Guam as an example of a small area affected greatly by the climate changes caused by major users of oil and gas worldwide, we will look at the past climate data and future data projections for Guam. We are likely to use temperatures and precipitation to start with. If we can find other data about Guam and how climate change is affecting them, we will incorporate that data as well in order to draw a more complete picture of how climate change is expected to affect this territory and in  hopes of being able to suggest what we can do to help Guam cope with their changing climate is ways that help their humaan population thrive. The idea is to understand how very small territories and nations are adversely being affected by what the most powerful nations are doing to harm our planet in hopes of educating more people to start taking climate changes seriously now in order to prevent harm and destribution of our shared planet.

## Interesting facts about Guam
Guam is an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States in the Micronesia subregion of the western Pacific Ocean. Guam's capital is Hagåtña, and the most populous village is Dededo. Guam became a U.S. territory in 1898 and placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. The Guam Organic Act of 1950 conferred U.S. citizenship on Guamanians and established the territory's government. The Act also transferred Federal jurisdiction over Guam from the U.S. Navy to the Department of the Interior.

## Our Story
As a group, we wanted to focus on a topic that would be of interest to everyone in the group.  Our topic of interest became climate change because it can affect people, cities, and farming. 

Using Guam as an example, we looked at past climate data based on temperature, precipitation, and more.  We focused on Guam because it is a small island to zoom in on, but also because “the number of farms and land in farms more than doubled, and the value of agricultural production increased”( census,2017).

Our question for this project was whether we can predict climate data for Guam for the year 2024.  Our hope is that we can predict how it would affect the country and make suggestions on how farmers can cope with the changing climate. As recommended by our instructor, we can use machine learning to  analyze 10 years of Guam’s climate data and predict data for the year 2024.
According to the pacific farmer organizations, “ The farms of subsistence and small commercial producers are primarily located in the villages of Barrigada, Dededo, Merizo, Mangilao, and Yigo”. 

## Where we get some data
Since most of the farm areas are around the international airport, weather data from that station was obtained. According to the pacific farmer organizations, “ The farms of subsistence and small commercial producers are primarily located in the villages of Barrigada, Dededo, Merizo, Mangilao, and Yigo”. These areas are located around Guam's interntional airport.

The data comes from the National Centers for Environmental Information National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We collected a total of 11 CSV files to analyze about 10 years of climate data for Guam.  The data contains information about liquid precipitation, sea level pressure, temperatures, wind, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and more. We also gathered data from National Centers for Environmental Information

## Work in progress 
# Database
We are using PostgreSQL for this project.
7.1.5 Create ERDs
https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
1. We need an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD)
2. A document describing the ERD (schema)
3. Data used for testing
4. provide information on how many tables were created and a summary of the process.

# Model
1.	Machine learning model will be covered in class today:
Note: Analyze the input data and if the input data is labeled, choose a supervised learning model.
Analyze the output data and if the output of the model should predict a value or outcome, choose regression.
We need to answer:
    Why did you choose this model?
    How will you train the model?
    What’s the accuracy of the model?
    How does the model work?
    If statistics are involved, which ones will the analysis include, and why?
    What would you include or change if you had more time?
2.	Choose an algorithm!
Ex. Linear regression.
3.	Include a summary of the process.

Visuals
We will use Tableau for this project. We need the following:
1.	Storyboard on Google Slide(s) ?
2.	 Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create final dashboard 
3.	Description of interactive element(s)
4.	Include a summary of the process.
