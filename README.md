# Project Overview:  
## Why study Climate Change?
Using the US territory Guam as an example of a small area affected greatly by the climate changes caused by major users of oil and gas worldwide, we will look at the past climate data and future data projections for Guam. We are likely to use temperatures and precipitation to start with. If we can find other data about Guam and how climate change is affecting them, we will incorporate that data as well in order to draw a more complete picture of how climate change is expected to affect this territory and in  hopes of being able to suggest what we can do to help Guam cope with their changing climate is ways that help their humaan population thrive. The idea is to understand how very small territories and nations are adversely being affected by what the most powerful nations are doing to harm our planet in hopes of educating more people to start taking climate changes seriously now in order to prevent harm and destribution of our shared planet.

## Interesting facts about Guam
Guam is an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States in the Micronesia subregion of the western Pacific Ocean. Guam's capital is Hagåtña, and the most populous village is Dededo. Guam became a U.S. territory in 1898 and placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. The Guam Organic Act of 1950 conferred U.S. citizenship on Guamanians and established the territory's government. The Act also transferred Federal jurisdiction over Guam from the U.S. Navy to the Department of the Interior.
