# Project Overview-  Climate Change
Using the US territory Guam as an example, we will look at the past climate data and future data projections for Guam. We are likely to use temperatures and precipitation to start with. If we can find other data about Guam and how climate change is affecting them, we will incorporate that data as well in order to draw a more complete picture of how climate change is expected to affect this territory and in  hopes of being able to suggest what we can do to help Guam cope with their changing climate is ways that help their humaan population thrive. 

Guam became a U.S. territory in 1898 and placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. The Guam Organic Act of 1950 conferred U.S. citizenship on Guamanians and established the territory's government. The Act also transferred Federal jurisdiction over Guam from the U.S. Navy to the Department of the Interior.
